        <h2 class="about-title">About</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
        I am an ambitious engineer with a background in industrial electronics and automation, and an avid programmer. 
        I enjoy solving problems in creative ways, and I am constantly learning new things.

        <h2 class="about-title">Experience aboard</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            At the age of 19, I had a volunteer experience in Belgium with one of my best friends. We spent 2 months living in a contemporary art museum
            that holds some incredibly bizarre artworks. Our favourite was by far the "Casaanus", which is basically an Anus house:
            <br>

            <span class="image-container-casa">
                <img src="img/casaanus.jpg" alt="casaanus" class="casa-image">
            </span> 

            I did not have the chance to sleep there, but I had to clean that house every week; still awesome.
            <br>
            At 22 I went to Germany and spent an entire year there. First I did an Erasmus semester for 6 months where I wrote and presented my bachelor's thesis, which was 
            done with a German company. After its successful completion, I was very fortunate to be selected by NI (National Instruments) to perform a 6-month long internship
            with them in Munich. It was a life-changing experience, working alongside top-tier engineers and attending world-renowned events such as NI Connect. Not only my 
            technical skills had improved substiantially, but my language skills, in both English and German, had had an amazing improvement.

        <h2 class="about-title">Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
            Engineers can also be athletes, you know? Since very young I have been amazed at the joy that comes with achieving goals, and practicing sports is one of those fields that 
            lets you have a continuous growth as long as you are persistent. I have done basketball, gymnastics, swimming and martial arts. Among these, martial arts and gymnastics are
            by far the ones I've enjoyed the most.
            Apart from sports, I like to chill with my friends and loved ones. Otherwise my time is spent engineering on my computer. Either coding, taking technical courses, planning projects,
            or even playing videogames.
            I also enjoy some sciense-fiction every now and then.
