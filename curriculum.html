            <p class="job-desc">NI develops automated test and measurement systems, and it is widely recognized for its LabVIEW software,
                and for their ambitious engineering.
                I developed and designed an application that aimed to reduce energy usage at the office which now saves up to â‚¬50K annually worth of energy. 
                This web application enabled NI employees worldwide to remotely start their test systems so that they do not need to be on 24/7, and it was achieved
                by setting up the necessary network infrastructure composed by IoT servers distributed across all subnets that broadcast WOL packets accordingly. 
                Other responsibilities include providing customer support to customers and to users at the NI Community forum.
