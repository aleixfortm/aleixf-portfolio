                and for their ambitious engineering.
                I developed and designed an application that aimed to reduce energy usage at the office which now saves up to â‚¬50K annually worth of energy. 
                This web application enables NI employees worldwide to remotely start their test systems so that they do not need to be powered on 24/7, and I achieved it by
                by setting up the necessary network infrastructure composed by IoT servers distributed across all subnets, and then broadcast WOL packets accordingly. 
                Other responsibilities include providing support to customers, as well as users at the NI Community forum.

                Wiska manufactures electrical equipment for shipbuilding and other diverse industries. I, alongside a team of 3 other
                European students, worked on a project presented by the company, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions from
                their manufacturing processes. Using the provided data by our manager and after thorough research on greenhouse gas
                calculations, we created a GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol guide for the company to follow.
                During the whole project I assumed the position of team leader, and I was responsible for follow-up presentations 
                at the company, as well as for the organisation of the team.
