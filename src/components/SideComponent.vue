            <span class="quote1">"</span>I have been tinkering with computers since I was too young to remember; I was born with the mind of an engineer. That's why, back in 2018, right after finishing high school, 
            I decided to pursue a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. During my years of study, I have been extensively working on personal projects, which lie
            in software development such as web applications, and systems programming with microcontrollers. I have also got plenty of technical support engineering experience after internships
            at <a href="https://www.ni.com/" class="text-color-4 link">NI</a> and <a href="https://www.criteo.com" class="text-color-4 link">Criteo</a>, great multinational companies.

            In my free time I enjoy reading books- especially sci-fi novels-, practicing gymnastics and martial arts, and of course working on some tech projects of my own.<span class="quote2">"</span>
